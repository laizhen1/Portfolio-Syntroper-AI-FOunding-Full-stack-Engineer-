About Me

I am a final-year BSc Computer Science student at Victoria University of Wellington, specialising in Cybersecurity with strong full-stack development experience. Since moving to New Zealand in 2016, I’ve adapted to the Kiwi lifestyle and built professional fluency in English, enabling me to thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments.

Beyond my studies, I develop and maintain production-ready web applications, including a bilingual corporate website for Guangdong Kansaitom Technology Ltd. (Vue3 + Spring Boot + MyBatis). I bring a strong competitor’s mindset — learning quickly, embracing challenges, and treating every project as a chance to sharpen my craft.

Outside of tech, I enjoy football and badminton, which fuel my team-athlete mentality and reinforce my commitment to continuous training, resilience, and performance.
